      "heading1": "Recognizing Soft Skills",
      "introTitle": "Why Soft Skills Matter",
      "introP1": "In traditional education, hard skills like lab work, calculus, or attending lectures are often graded. These are tangible, teachable abilities usually gained through formal training.",
      "introP2": "But soft skills—like communication, time management, or teamwork are equally important and often go unrecognized. They're vital in study environments, group projects, and future careers.",
      "hardVsSoftHeader": "How Open Badges Bridge the Gap",
      "hardSoftText": "Open Badges help validate soft skills by linking them to real experiences, behaviors, and contributions. This gives learners a way to showcase strengths that transcripts don't capture but employers and educators highly value."
    },
    "section2": {
      "metadataHeader": "Why Metadata Matters",
      "metadataP1": "Metadata in Open Badges refers to the embedded information that defines the badge’s purpose, issuer, and the accomplishment it represents. It’s the behind-the-scenes data that transforms a badge from just a visual icon into a meaningful and verifiable credential.",
      "metadataP2": "This contextual information allows educators, employers, and peers to understand not just what the badge looks like, but what it stands for. Metadata validates the credibility of the badge, ensuring it reflects a real achievement with clearly defined criteria.",
      "metadataInclude": "Open Badge Metadata",
      "metadataP3": "A well-formed Open Badge must include core metadata fields such as the common information like name of the badge, description and image, which forms a Badge Class. The issue date, issuer's organisation, the criteria that were met to obtain the badge, and a description of the achievement also have to be included. For identification purposes most often an encrypted email of the recipient is used, as your information is PII(Personally Identifiable Information), and attaching PII as metadata to very publically available items could be a security concern.",
      "metadataP4": "Alignment and Evidence attachments are typically issued for the most highly-regarded badges, usually after peer-reviews by higher education institutions and are not necessary for all Open Badges. At the end of this journey your badge will take some time to deliver, as we'll have these attachments issued for you! Finally, optional fields like issuer contacts or visual flair are rarely attached to save data throughput."
    },
    "section3": {
      "badgeMeaningHeader": "What Do These Badges Represent?",
      "badgeP1": "Open Badges represent a modern way of recognizing a learner's full range of contributions. Rather than certifying a single task or activity, badges highlight meaningful experiences that reflect multiple soft skills and real-world engagement.",
      "badgeP2": "At Vilnius Tech, badges are used to acknowledge areas like scientific research, international involvement, and student leadership among many others. These are earned through combinations of initiative, communication, collaboration, cultural awareness, and peer support.",
      "badgeP3": "The following examples show how badges can reflect broader competencies, helping students tell a more complete story about their abilities and values.",

      "badgeCredHeader": "Why Are They Trusted Microcredentials?",
      "badgeP4": "Because badges are awarded based on demonstrated competencies and reviewed against academic standards, they carry meaningful weight. They show not just what a learner knows but how they apply those skills in real-world, team-based, and intercultural contexts. This makes them a reliable, portable form of recognition for both academic and professional environments."
    },
    "section4": {
      "mergeStructureHeader": "From Individual Badges to Meta and Uber Badges",
      "mergeP1": "Each Open Badge already represents a combination of competencies, but as participants engage in a subject, they often earn many related badges. Over time, this can result in badge overload with dozens of recognitions that could be more meaningful if combined.",
      "mergeP2": "To address this, badges can be merged into more advanced forms. When a learner collects at least three related Open Badges, they may be combined into a Meta Badge. A Meta Badge represents broader mastery in a specific field and belongs to a higher badge class than standard badges.",
      "mergeP3": "Those who go even further by earning most or all Meta Badges in a domain may be awarded an Uber Badge, which is a combination of Meta badges. Uber Badges signify the highest level of recognition, combining multiple Meta Badges to reflect advanced, sustained excellence. One of many goals of the system is to be a solution for equating these higher class badges to scientific achievements but within the soft-skill spectrum.",
      "mergeDisplayHeader": "Badge Wallets",
      "mergeP4": "With many badges earned over time, effective display becomes important. Badge wallets allow users to curate their most important or impressive achievements into a clean, shareable format. These wallets can be used in CVs, applications, or professional platforms like LinkedIn to present skills clearly and strategically. Combined badges make the sharing process easier by decluttering and focusing your achievements, and it's automatic, too, as you're about to find out."

      "slidingHeader": "Badges for Different Audiences",
      "slidingP1": "Open Badges carry meaningful value for both individuals and organizations. They are not limited to student achievement as they support broader recognition goals across sectors.",
      "slidingP2": "For students, badges make soft skills and informal learning visible, enable easier access to international opportunities, and help build a narrative of growth and capability.",
      "slidingP3": "For employers, badges offer clear, standardized insights into a candidate’s competencies, help track internal development, and contribute to more targeted and equitable hiring.",
      "slidingHowHeader": "Shared Value Through Recognition",
      "slidingP4": "When both sides understand and trust badge meaning, it strengthens mutual recognition. Badges become a common language linking personal progress with organizational priorities. Improving this relationship has been the goal of this site's journey and we're glad you're nearly at the finish line."
